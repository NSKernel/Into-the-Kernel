# Intel SGX in Linux - Under Construction

Intel SGX provides something that is known as an _enclave_. Basically a secret room in which no one else knows what's happening inside. The memory of it is fully encrypted and integrity-checked, and every time it exits the CPU will flush all buffer and cache. So if you are doing something like an SSH key computing then SGX will be a very safe place to do it.

The code inside the enclave works like a shared library
